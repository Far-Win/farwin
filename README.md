# FarWin
Far.Win is a prize game on Farcaster that is designed to be used for fundraising. Players buy randomly generated Mondrian-style art and 15% of the purchase goes to the cause, public good or project. Bots enter with profit motivated capital when the prize pool grows enough for a probablitic return making this the first unconditiional leverage of private finance for public good funding (PGF) in history.
